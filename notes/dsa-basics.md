# DSA Basics

Data Structures are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations.

Common data structures includes arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem.

Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.

**_efficiently -> performance, memory_**

### Algos definition

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures designed to solve specific problems and perform tasks efficiently in the realm of computer science and mathematics.

### ADT - Abstract data type

Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations. The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.

## Big O Notation, Time complexity

Space complexity -> less memory

Time complexity -> less time

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm.

So when someone says Oh of N, they mean your algorithm will grow linearily based on input.

- O(1) -> constant time
- O(log n) -> logarithmic time
- O(n) -> linear time
- O(n log n) -> linearithmic time
- O(n^2) -> quadratic time
- O(2^n) -> exponential time
- O(n!) -> factorial time
